      If I close my eyes whenever I'm tired, an adventure will be triggered. The immense darkness leads me into a flying bird, rising all the way from the ground to the atmosphere, from the atmosphere to a height in the universe overlooking the
      earth. Although <i>Powers of Ten</i> visualized most of this trip, unique scenes can be seen through one’s own eyes.

      In my case, for example, all the existing spaces are gradually becoming enclosed containers like a Matryoshka doll. And my body is the container of a container of a container of a container…The lack of gaps and circulation in the system make the
      situation very tricky and dangerous. Any kind of eruption will lead to serious consequences. The whole world becomes a gamble on endurance.

      The spirit maintains sharp vigilance, keeping rejecting things all the time.
