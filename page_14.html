      <pre style="font-size:0.8em;">
      You return home
      moon-landed, foreign;
      the Earth's gravitational pull
      an effort now redoubled,
      dragging your shoelaces loose
      and your shoulders
      etching deeper the stanza
      of worry on your forehead.
      You return home deepened,
      a parched well linked to tomorrow
      by a frail strand of…

      Anyway...

      You sigh into the onslaught of identical days.
      One might as well, at a time...

      Well...
      Anyway...
      You're back.
