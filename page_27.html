      The sun goes up and down
      like a tired whore,
      the weather immobile
      like a broken limb
      while you just keep getting older.
      Nothing moves but
      the shifting tides of salt in your body.
      Your vision blears.
      You carry your weather with you,
      the big blue whale,
      a skeletal darkness.

      You come back
      with X-ray vision.
      Your eyes have become a hunger.
      You come home with your mutant gifts
      to a house of bone.
      Everything you see now,
      all of it: bone.
