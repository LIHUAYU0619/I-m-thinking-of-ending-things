      Coming home is terrible
      whether the dogs lick your face or not;
      whether you have a wife
      or just a wife-shaped loneliness waiting for you.
      Coming home is terribly lonely,
      so that you think
      of the oppressive barometric pressure
      back where you have just come from
      with fondness,
      because everything's worse
      once you're home.

      You think of the vermin
      clinging to the grass stalks,
      long hours on the road,
      roadside assistance and ice creams,
      and the peculiar shapes of
      certain clouds and silences
      with longing because you did not want to return.
      Coming home is
      just awful.

      And the home-style silences and clouds
      contribute to nothing
      but the general malaise.
      Clouds, such as they are,
      are in fact suspect,
      and made from a different material
      than those you left behind.
      You yourself were cut
      from a different cloudy cloth,
      returned,
      remaindered,
      ill-met by moonlight,
      unhappy to be back,
      slack in all the wrong spots,
      seamy suit of clothes
      dishrag-ratty, worn.

      ...
