      In the daytime, she read a poem named <i>The Sleeper in the Valley</i> by Rimbaud. She had been thinking about that poem and likes it very much.
      <br>

      <div class="poem"><i>It is a green hollow where a stream gurgles,<br>
          Crazily catching silver rags of itself on the grasses;<br>
          Where the sun shines from the proud mountain:<br>
          It is a little valley bubbling over with light.<br>
          <br>

          A young soldier, open-mouthed, bare-headed,<br>
          With the nape of his neck bathed in cool blue cresses,<br>
          Sleeps; he is stretched out on the grass, under the sky,<br>
          Pale on his green bed where the light falls like rain.<br>
          <br>

          His feet in the yellow flags, he lies sleeping. Smiling as<br>
          A sick child might smile, he is having a nap:<br>
          Cradle him warmly, Nature: he is cold.<br>
          <br>
          No odour makes his nostrils quiver;<br>
          He sleeps in the sun, his hand on his breast<br>
          At peace. There are two red holes in his right side.</i>
      </div>

      <br>

      Unexpectedly, during that night, she had a weird dream of a poem.
      <br><br>

      <div class="poem">
        <i>When he looked into the hole,<br>
        He saw Rimbaud‘s poetry at the bottom.<br>
        Then a bullet ruthlessly came to his right eye,<br>
        He suddenly became a Cyclops.<br>
        But He was pretty glad with that,<br>
        He knew it was Rimbaud kissing him.
        </i></div>
      <br>
      This was the first time she very clearly remembered a poem from a dream. Although short, it was exciting. She wrote it down immediately after wake-up, for fear of forgetting it.
