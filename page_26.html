      Fears are hairs. That’s what I have felt from childhood. A piece of hair sticks to the skin. Another piece of hair gets into the food. If hairs accumulate little and become more, they are powerful to form a fine barrier. I used to clean the blocked water pipe with my bare hands. The hair that got into my palm should be a certain kind of parasite.
