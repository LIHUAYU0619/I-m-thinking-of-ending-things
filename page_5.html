      At midnight, with auditory hallucinations of blood dripping on the wooden floor, she kept thinking about cutting the wrist with kitchen knife. But in the end, instead of doing that, she only marked the position of the artery with a red pen.
      This subconscious behavior somehow reminded her of the watch she drew on the wrist of a boy next to her desk in the junior high school. She felt a little bored and soon fell asleep.
      <br><br>
      The next day, she read: “Who could have realized that whenever he embraced a young child with rosy cheeks he longed to slice off those cheeks with a razor, and he would have done it many times had he not been restrained by the thought of Justice
      with her long funereal procession of punishments.”
