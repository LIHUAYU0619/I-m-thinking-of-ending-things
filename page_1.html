      <span class="japan">岸辺露伴</span> (Kishibe Rohan) is dying for truth. He would do anything in order to experience truth. The   <span class="japan">スタンド</span> (Stand) of <span class="japan">露伴</span> is called Heaven’s Door — this ability can turn anyone’s body into a book, allowing him to learn everything about that person. He
      uses people’s real feelings and stories for his manga inspiration. However, when an emergency happens, he can immediately write or change the narrative to alter one’s memories and behaviors.
