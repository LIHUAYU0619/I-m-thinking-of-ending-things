      It is said that deep breathing can alleviate the disease and improve one’s mood. But isn’t a deep breath at the same time a long, worried sigh?<br><br>

      Barthes once says that stammer is a kind of rustling. That may be generated by the rustling of leaves around one’s mouth.<br><br>
      According to my rich experience in sighing, I guess it must be along with a breeze when every single “Ah” come out of the throat. A breeze should relieve some of my worries.
